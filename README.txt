TIP CALCULATOR


I used this tutorial:
https://codepen.io/cphemm/pen/reNwWd

I added style to the dropdown menu, by hiding the dropdown and covering it with some CSS.
I also added some JS to show the result per person at the bottom of the calculator.


What I need to improve:
- I want to give more style to the dropdown list
- I want to add a reset button
